# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis



## Background

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title (Requierments)

-A query is written and executed to create a Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. (10 pt)

-The Retirement Titles table is exported as retirement_titles.csv.

-A query is written and executed to create a Unique Titles table that contains the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title. (15 pt)

-The Unique Titles table is exported as unique_titles.csv.

-A query is written and executed to create a Retiring Titles table that contains the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring. (10 pt)

-The Retiring Titles table is exported as retiring_titles.csv.

## Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (Requierments)

-Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

-Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

## Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (Execution)

-Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

In this challenge, we are determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifing employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

-Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.

-32452: Staff

-29415: Senior Engineer

-14221: Engineer

-8047: Senior Staff

-4502: Technique Leader

-1761: Assistant Engineer

-these numbers represent the individuals who could retire at any given time. THIS IS A LOT. Steps need to be taken to fill soon to be vacant positions and to dampen the blow
that will come from less experienced workers. 

-I have a particular amount of worry due to Senior Engineers making up roughly a third of our soon to retire workers. This is what one would assume is a high-skilled position, 
requiring a particular number of years worth of experience to perform effectively. 

-Senior staff may also be challenging to replace for similar reasons to Senior Engineers. 

-There is a low amount of individuals who can fill the mentorship program so having retiring employees teach the younger ones will not (likely) be enough to solve the problem.

-Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

-90,398 roles will need to be filled and the company should make haste as it consideres replacments. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

-No, we only have a little less than 2,000 employees who are capable of participating in the mentorship program. That pails in comparison to the 90,000 who are close to leaving.
